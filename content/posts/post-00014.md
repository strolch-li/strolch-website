## Strolch Reports

Strolch can do reports!

-------

A feature we haven't written about yet is the report API. Strolch has it's own
API to generate reports of data, and since we have a generic model, we use
`Resource` of type `Report` to define them.

Go check out the [documentation](/documentation/reports) and then enjoy using this easy way to deliver the
reports your peers require.
