## Strolch Searches

Strolch queries are deprecated!

-------

Strolch has had once again many changes, and fixes etc. One important thing to
note is that we have removed support for transactional mode and have rewritten
how models are searched. Thus the search API was born.

Go check out the [Strolch Search](/documentation/searches) documentation and
then go rewrite your searches =)).

Strolch tag [1.6.51](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cstrolch "{target='_blank'}") has all
those juicy changes!
