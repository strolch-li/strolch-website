## Strolch Documentation

Any good software has some decent documentation explaining concepts, best
practices and gives examples.

-------

So this post is to announce that there is now a new page on Strolch's website
with a bit of documentation. This first documentation explains the Strolch
runtime and some of the do and don't in Strolch code.

Bear with us, writing documentation takes time and can be outdated quickly, so
we will make an effort to keep everything up to date and add more documentation,
but this is a start.

So go ahead and read the [documentation](/documentation) , and if you haven't already, also read
the rest of the website which should give some more insight into the [what](/), [why](/history)
and [how](/api) of Strolch.
