## About

The official Strolch blog with news, ideas, and thoughts on using Strolch.

Strolch is an open source component based software agent written in Java and can
be compared, in a light sense, with the Java EE stack: Strolch takes care of
persistence, implements Services for use cases, Commands as re-usable algorithms
and has a parameterized data model.
