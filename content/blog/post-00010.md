## Versioning of objects

Opt-In versioning of objects

-------

A major new feature has landed in Strolch. Now, using opt-in, it is possible to
have all changes to the object model be versioned. This means that any change to
`Order`, `Resource` or `Activity` is automatically versioned and one can then revert
to this version later on.

This will make it far easier to implement undo operations in applications since
it is an inherent part of the lifecycle of objects in Strolch.

Since Strolch is supposed to be used also in small footprint hardware, this
option is opt-in.

A side affect of this new feature is that we have for the time being not ported
the XML persistence layer. If this is required, then someone drop us a note and
we'll check on it.

So now go ahead and add `<enableVersioning>true</enableVersioning>` to your Realm
so that versioning is enabled.
