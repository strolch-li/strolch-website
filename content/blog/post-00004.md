## DurationParameter and other minor changes: Release 1.0.0-RC4

New `DurationParameter` and additional minor changes: Release of 1.0.0-RC4 which
can be downloaded on the [download page](/download).

-------

While implementing a use case in a Strolch based application it was detected
that an essential parameter type was missing, the `DurationParameter`. This
parameter currently stores the value as a long in memory and serializes to
[ISO8601](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations).
As soon as we move Strolch to Java8, we will change this to use the
`Period` class in the new Java8 date and time API.

In addition to the new parameter, a couple of other changes were made:

* 32c1785 [Major] Added Session timeout handling
* d55371e [Minor] fixed component version descriptions
* c1cdfbb [Bugfix] added missing cloning of StringSetTimedState in Resources
* 8f50a15 [Major] changed XML format of time value of TimedStates to be ISO8601
* 5fbbe50 [Bugfix] fix NPE when cloning Resources with no state vars
* b77f4b2 [New] added TimeVariable.clear()-method
* Updated sub-module ch.eitchnet.utils to 906d24d
* Updated sub-module ch.eitchnet.privilege to aa16887

So, Strolch 1.0.0-RC4 is out the door, go ahead and [try it out](/download).
