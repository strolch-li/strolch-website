## Release 1.2.0

Release of Strolch 1.2.0

-------

A few months ago we informed of the soon to be released version 1.1.0. Well, we
decided to jump to 1.2.0 because we did some refactorings. All the eitchnet
projects have been melted into Strolch and thus now it's all one nice package.
This will result in simpler development and less constraints on APIs between the
two projects.

Other than that, not much changed, but we are continually working on Strolch, so
go grab your latest copy and have fun coding!
