## Strolch 1.8.5 and PLC 1.2.2 are out!

JDK 17 ready!

-------

Unbelievable, but the entire 1.7.x branch was never blogged about or deployed to Maven. We did do quite a few releases
of the Java 11 version, but never got around to releasing to Maven.

Now we have released the 1.8.x branch of Strolch and deployed
to [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=li.strolch).

The 1.8.x branch requires JDK 17, but is still on Tomcat 9.x. We will create a new branch for Tomcat 10.x and release
that at a later date.

We also just released the Strolch PLC 1.2.x branch. This branch uses Strolch 1.8.x and is production ready.

So, Strolch 1.8.5 is out the door, go ahead and [try it out](/download).
