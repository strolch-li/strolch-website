## Let's build a bookshop!

In this tutorial we will build a book store using Strolch. This book store will
be without a UI, but we will do everything using REST APIs, which should make it
easy to add a UI later using whatever framework suits one most.

The book store will have the following features:

* The store owner can add, update and remove books
* The store owner can edit the stock quantity
* Users can view a list of books
* Users can add books to a virtual cart
* Users can create and verify an account using an e-mail address
* Users can submit an order for the books in their cart
* The store owner can see the orders by state (pending, preparing, sent)
* The store owner can update the state of an order (preparing, sent)
* Notify the user when the order is sent

The code to the book can be downloaded
from [GitHub](https://github.com/strolch-li/strolch-bookshop) and will be updated
as this tutorial is updated.

The tutorial consists of the following parts:
