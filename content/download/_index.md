## Download

Strolch is
on [Maven central](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/li.strolch/li.strolch.agent)
, but if the latest version is not there, then build it locally. A guide can be
found on the [development](/development) page.

Strolch is also built on [Jenkins](https://ci.4trees.ch/), so you can see if the
latest version passes all tests.
